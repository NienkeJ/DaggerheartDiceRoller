# DaggerheartDiceRoller
A super simple dice roller with Hope and Fear tracker for Daggerheart.

Inspired by the 'Craps roller' in chapter 3 of [Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, 3rd ed.](https://archive.org/details/pythonprogrammin0000daws/mode/2up) and the 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game in chapter 2 of Al Sweigart's [Automate the boring stuff with python, 2nd ed](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).
